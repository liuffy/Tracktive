Tracktive is a single-page, full-stack web playlist creation application inspired by [8tracks](http://8tracks.com/) intended to be a clean, lightweight clone of the original website. It is built on a Rails backend with a PostgreSQL database, and it uses React with a Redux architectural framework on the frontend.
