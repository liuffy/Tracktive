# Tracktive

[Tracktive Live](http://link.com)

Tracktive is a single-page, full-stack web playlist creation application inspired by [8tracks](http://8tracks.com/). It was created with the goal to design a clean, lightweight (and **tracktive**) clone of the original website. It is built on a *Ruby on Rails* backend with a *PostgreSQL* database, and uses *React.js* with a *Redux* architectural framework on the frontend.
